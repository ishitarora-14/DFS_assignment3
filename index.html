    <p class="about_desc">Hayao Miyazaki is a Japanese animator, director, producer, screenwriter, author, and manga
      artist. A co-founder of <strong>Studio Ghibli</strong>, he has attained international acclaim as a masterful
      storyteller and creator of Japanese animated feature films, and is widely regarded as one of the most accomplished
      filmmakers in the history of animation.Born in Tokyo City in the Empire of Japan, Miyazaki expressed interest in
      manga and animation from an early age, and he joined Toei Animation in 1963. During his early years at Toei
      Animation he worked as an in-between artist, notable films to which Miyazaki contributed at Toei include
      <i>Gulliver's Travels Beyond the Moon</i>. Miyazaki co-founded Studio Ghibli in 1985. he films were met with
      critical and commercial success in Japan. Miyazaki's film <i>Princess Mononoke</i> was the first animated film
      ever to win the Japan Academy Prize for Picture of the Year, and briefly became the highest-grossing film in Japan
      following its release in 1997, its distribution to the Western world greatly increased Ghibli's popularity and
      influence outside Japan. His 2001 film <i>Spirited Away</i> became the highest-grossing film in Japanese history,
      winning the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, and is frequently ranked among the greatest films of the
      2000s. Following the release of <i>The Wind Rises</i>, Miyazaki announced his retirement from feature films,
      though he returned in 2016 to work on the upcoming feature film How <i>Do You Live?</i> (2023). Miyazaki's works
      are characterized by the recurrence of themes such as humanity's relationship with nature and technology, the
      wholesomeness of natural and traditional patterns of living, the importance of art and craftsmanship, and the
      difficulty of maintaining a pacifist ethic in a violent world. The protagonists of his films are often strong
      girls or young women, and several of his films present morally ambiguous antagonists with redeeming qualities.</p>
